## 👨‍💻 Professional Experience

### **TikTok** | Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Search Rec)
*San Jose, CA | Aug 2022 - Present*

- **Business Impact:** Spearheaded search attribution overhaul, driving **+12.5%** in passive searches and **+8.3%** in CTR.
- **GenAI & RAG:** Architected Dual-Tower RAG-ready architecture with ColBERT-style late interaction. Fine-tuned multimodal LLMs (CLIP/GPT) to improve long-tail query understanding.
- **Scale:** Trained on **PB-scale** user interaction logs using hybrid loss (InfoNCE + BPR).
- **Causal Inference:** Deployed attribution scores using Hawkes-process to distinguish causal triggers from correlations.
- **Infra:** Optimized serving pipeline with **TensorRT**, handling **500M+ daily requests** with p95 latency < 25ms.

### **Siemens Research** | Machine Learning Research Intern
*Berkeley, CA | May 2021 - Aug 2021*

- Developed **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** agents for traffic simulation, reducing collision risk by **35%**.
- Implemented **PPO and DDPG** algorithms in PyTorch for realistic driving dynamics.
